06.09.2001:  replace the signal signalCreatePlayer by the virtual function
             createPlayer. It has the same arguments but the return value
             is the new player
06.09.2001:  the KGameConfig dialog changes the paramter initConfigs from bool
             to long. Use the ConfigOptions to specify what options you want
             to have enabled. Default is all
06.09.2001:  some int->Q_UINT32 in sender, receiver and player parameters. maybe
             more will follow.
06.09.2001:  KGameIO::signalPrepareMove(..., bool&) ->
             KGameIO::signalPrepareMove(..., bool*): don't know why this was
             necessary but it didn't work anymore...
