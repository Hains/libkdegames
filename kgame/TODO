- 18.02.2001: Network Init can be called more than once. Has very interesting
              effects ;-). Should be prevented (if (connected()) return false; ??
              Kind of fixed?
- 23.02.2001: doku: signalPlayerInput/playerInput are main functions. Must be
              explained
- 24.02.2001: KGameErrorDialog::slotVersionError(): cookie and version (local and remote) must be shown in the message 
              TODO: more parameters to signal
- 26.02.2001: load/save games check and improve if not working. load/save signals needed??
- 27.02.2001: non-KGame KGameDialog?
- 28.02.2001: Direct computer player for kpoker like games support needs to be improved
- 28.02.2001: Non existing properties in load should be created, resp like the player
              creation a signal should prompt the player.
              Problem, are these properties deleted? Maybe a flag canDelete?
- 05.03.2001: Documentation. Especially KGameIO is nearly undocumented. I am
              thinking of an explaination of the class + methods and example
              code for the "key" methods. A sample implementation in a small
              game (like the current kdenonbeta/kgame but with a real sense -
              mabye use the QT tic-tac-toe example?) would be very great (this
              could be stuff of a tutorial instead of KGame documentation)
              MH: Even better idea
- 11.04.2001: KGameDialog cannot configure KMessageServer :-(
- 16.04.2001: removePlayer() has been redesigned for KGameComServer but still
              has to be tested. I don't have any way to do this currently, as
              kgame mostly removes players on destruct
- 25.05.2001: connect to the signal KGameNetwork::connectionBroken and start a
              local non-network game
- 25.05.2001: rewrite KGame::slotClientDisconnected
- 03.06.2001: can KGameNetwork::sendSystemMessage made protected (maybe using
              friends)? sendSystenMessage AND sendMessage is very confusing to
              the user... same applies to e.g. sendProperty which is internal
- 03.06.2001: can we translate the group of a KPlayer? Probably not as there are
              no international connections possible then... maybe a group id?
- 05.06.2001: KGameDialog::saveConfig(KConfig*) might be useful (as well as
              KGameDialog::loadConfig(KConfig*). Should set an own group in the
              config file (setGroup("KGameDialog")). Problem: shalll network
              settings be saved? Could be used for startup configuration (i.e.
              load the config of the previous game) otherwise.
- 21.06.2001: KPlayerPropertyArray does not yet support at() and operator[]
              assignments. Need to check whether the method from QBitArray
              can be applied
- 11.07.2001: go through the entire API documentation and change/delete what is
              obsolete.
